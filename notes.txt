copypasta notes

On top of the already provided answers there is a very nice pattern in Python that allows you to enumerate both keys and values of a dictionary.

for i, (k, v) in enumerate(example_dict.items()):
    print(i, k, v)

In Python 3.8+, you can use assignment expressions (operator :=):
if (x := 3) == 5:
    print("that's odd")

        # object = dates[date_choice]
        # object_methods = [method_name for method_name in dir(object)
        #                  if callable(getattr(object, method_name))]
        # pprint(object_methods)


backup / unused:
# account_return = client.get_account()
# print(account_return)

# services_return = client.get_services() 
# print(services_return)
#
# account_balance = client.get_account_balance()
# print(account_balance)
#
# sender_addresses = client.get_sender_addresses()
# print(sender_addresses)
#
# payment_methods = client.get_payment_methods()
# print(payment_methods)

# automatic_topup_enabled = client.enable_automatic_topups(
#     '100', payment_methods[0].payment_method_id, payment_methods[0].payment_method_id)
# print(automatic_topup_enabled)

# automatic_topup_disabled = client.disable_automatic_topups()
# print(automatic_topup_disabled)
